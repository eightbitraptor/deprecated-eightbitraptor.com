        <h3>Systems Administrator, Reevoo.com, August 2008 - present</h3>
        <p>Reevoo.com is a later stage start up based in South London. I work here as one of two Systems Administration staff. I have a wide variety of responsibilities including the maintenance and deployment of Reevoo.com and it's supporting stack through several environments (local dev and qa, staging and production in a remote data center), application and server monitoring, data management and backup and the commissioning of new machines. I also provide desktop support and maintenance to the company desktops and laptops for about 30 employees, these range from Windows XP machines for business users to Mac's for the development staff and some early apotion Windows 7 machines for testing purposes.</p>
        <p>This position gives me day to day working knowledge of Apache, MySQL, Mongrel, Passenger, Ruby (and Rails), Nginx, Puppet, Capistrano as well as more standard sysadmin tools and practices such as RedHat Linux administration, Mac OSX and Windows Administrator, bash scripting, server monitoring strategies and many others</p>
        <h3>Research Student, University of Kent, September 2007-August 2008</h3>
        <p>I spent a year as part of a research group in the Computer Science department working on an industry sponsored project into pattern matching with respect to Network Intrusion Detection. This involved designing a pattern matching machine in hardware using FPGA's and the software to be able to program and control the matcher.</p>
        <p>During this position I gained experience in Java, Hardware Design, FPGA's and programmable architectures, VHDL, Finite Automata, Regular Expression and String pattern matching engines and algorithms.</p>
        <h3>Developer, Aurora Kendrick James Ltd, September 2006 - September 2007</h3>
        <p class="spaceafter">I was part of a small development team developing the next version of AKJ's popular CRM system for use by the telecoms industry, and in the process migrating the codebase from Delphi to C# using the .NET 2.0 framework. This position gave me experience in developing as part of a team to develop high quality software to a deadline and to client specs. </p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
        <h3>MSc Broadband and Mobile Communication Networks, University of Kent, September 2005 - September 2006</h3>
        <p>This was a one year taught Masters degree focussing around Networking and it's various implemenatation. I learned about TCP/IP and packet based networking. Ethernet, The Telecoms network, Optical communication. Digital Video Transmission and satellite communications</p>
        <p>It also involved a 6 month research project. Mine was a CAN bus demonstration board, carried out for a company in Portsmouth. This involved designing and manufacturing the circuit boards required for the project as well as writing the CAN bus interface software and a demonstration application for the board to run. This demonstration board was used as a demonstration board by the company to sell their CAN bus solution to clients.</p>
        <h3>BEng(Hons) Computer Systems Engineering (2:1), University of Kent, Sept 2001 - July 2005</h3>
        <p>This course involved a balanced mix of electronics and computer science, I learned different programming languages and paradigms such as OO programming with Java and functional parallel programming with Occam-Pi. I also learnt about microcontrollers, various computer architectures and how they are built. I also learned soldering skills, hardware design, analogue and digital electronics, and microcontroller programming in C</p>
        <p>My final year project involved designing and building an expansion card for a PC that provided a complete processor prototyping platform. It interfaced using the PCI bus and was based around an FPGA, had inbuilt SDRAM and multiple methods for programming the FPGA. It also contained JTAG headers and a seperate power supply so it could be used with or without a PC. My project won second place for "Best Undergraduate electronics project in Kent" when I graduated</p>
        <h3>A-Levels, Barton Court Grammar School, Canterbury</h3>
        <p class="spaceafter">I achieved A-Levels in Biology, Chemistry and Geography, and also have 9 GCSE's at grade C or above, including Maths(B), and English(B)</p>
    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>For fun I pick apart Linux, and enjoy testing different distributions. My current distro of choice is ArchLinux, although I'll always have a soft spot for Slackware. I enjoy programming and learning languages (I love Ruby and currently I'm starting to learn some functional programming). Some of my open source code can be seen on <a href="http://github.com/shadowaspect">my GitHub account</a>.</p>
    <p>I am a keen musician and play both Bass and Guitar, I am currently involved in a collaborative music project writing music over the internet using Git and Audacity. I have previously been involved in several bands, playing gigs and writing music. I listen to a lot of music and try to attend as many gigs as I can.</p>
    <p>I enjoy skateboarding, cycling and occasionally bouldering.</p>
