I downloaded the new Windows 7 beta a couple of weekends ago, and test drove it on a laptop I borrowed from work. These are the notes that I made while playing with it for an hour or so on the train to work (bad spelling and grammar included).

Bear in mind that I’m predominantly a UNIX geek who has only used Vista briefly, and only uses XP for light gaming.

Hardware tested on was an HP 2510p laptop with a 1.2GHz Core 2 Duo processor and 2Gb of RAM, it contains an Intel 915 video card and the Intel 4965 Wireless chipset (making it officially a Centrino pro platform).

Windows7 thoughts:

* Installation is pretty much the same as Vista, boot times and shut down times seem quicker, although I have nothing to compare against, I’ve never seen this hardware running Vista. suspend and resume is ninja fast, it’s almost got Apple beat.
* Interface feels much snappier than Vista, windows take less time to open and respond quicker to mouse movement etc.
* Start menu redesign, I like the recent files list, that’s specific to each app and that it’s less ostentatious overall than Vista’s
* Inclusion of PowerShell is probably a good thing. Would like to spend more time playing with it.
* Libraries! basically a view over all the files of a certain type in multiple directories. eg. Music library aggregates all mp3 files in your Music folder and the Public music folder by default: You can create and customize views but options are limited at the moment, worth keeping an eye on though.
* New taskbar: very different from old taskbar design, Quick launch and tasks now effectively merged into each other much easier to see what you’re using, also maximises taskbar real estate. Coupled with an effective preview system for when you hover over each taskbar icon this pretty much works!
* Enhanced Log Viewer, which I like. Have a funny feeling that this was in Vista, but I might have missed it
* Awesome power management settings, including control over CPU speed in different circumstances, and the ability to create your own custom power plans rather than just being able to make minor tweaks to existing plans. Don’t know if this was in Vista either.
* Notepad is still shit. Come on people (and this goes for Apple too) what would is take to give us a decent text editor out of the box?
* Start menu says shutdown by default now instead of the annoying suspend issue.
* As far as I can tell there is no way to adjust the windows Aero settings from the right click display menu. You need to dig around in performance settings, seems a little backward.
* Copying files is much speedier, especially the calculating stage before copy, only took ~5 seconds to recognise 41000 files totalling 6Gb (tested copying the contents of C:\Windows to a location in my home directory)
* I like the new Play – Burn – Sync tabbed layout in Media Player, although haven’t loaded any music into it so have no idea how it performs. also untested with my Samsung KP-T10 (an MTP device)
* And finally (this is the most awesome thing). They made Paint useful, I can now crop images and actually use it for basic image editing. Also Paint now saves in png by default which is very nice.

Overall, it’s pretty cool. I like it. Hopefully when it comes out I’ll have some good news when my relatives ask me if it’s safe to upgrade from XP yet!
