Just a short update to announce that I'm an author on the "Reevoo labs blog":http://www.reevoo.com/labs, and "my first article about unit testing Apache redirect rules using Test::Unit":http://www.reevoo.com/labs/2009/07/testing-apache-and-mod_rewrite-using-testunit/ is now live.

Labs is a place where us folks at Reevoo can talk about cool stuff that we are doing, or "announce the random crap that we get up to on thursday afternoons":http://www.reevoo.com/labs/2009/07/reevoo-santa/. We haven't been using it anywhere near as much as we should and as of now that's going to change!

As a general rule for the future anything I work on during business hours will be posted at the labs site, and anything about my personal code and random blurbs will remain here so stay tuned.
